      multiple projects and producing impressive results. A creative
      problem-solver and eager to learn, I would be a valuable asset to any
      development team. I am looking for a challenging and fulfilling position
      which allows me to put my abilities to good use and encourages
      professional growth.

      <h3>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, January 2018 to present</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          RPI is an internationally recognized research institute with a focus on engineering, advanced materials, and artificial intelligence. Very small web team, of which I was the only developer, needs to support dozens of websites for various existing and new projects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Recent wins have included removing or replacing Drupal 6 sites, keeping Drupal 7 and 8 sites up-to-date, developing a "starterkit" to make it easier to quickly "spin up" consistently on-brand, accessible, mobile-friendly websites, and documentation for my own sanity.
        </li>
      </ul>
        
      <h3>Overit Media, March 2013 to December 2016, Web Developer</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Overit Media is a digital marketing firm. The small development team
          worked closely with design and strategy teams to build everything from
          small websites for brochures and event promotion to incredibly complicated
          suites of software to support thousands of users.
        </li>
        <li>
          Responsibilities included back-end implementation using WordPress
          or Drupal, and front-end development using HTML5, CSS3, jQuery and
          responsive web design techniques. Additionally, regular maintenance
          and support was provided for projects, which included upgrading
          core and plugins, performance improvements and debugging end-user issues.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many recent projects required massive amounts of custom module
          development for Drupal 8.

          Projects ranged from on-line viewbooks that integrate with social
          media, to massive applications that allow users to apply for
          technical certification. Many projects involved working with
          designers and front end implementation, using existing APIs and
          libraries, and developing custom functionality.
